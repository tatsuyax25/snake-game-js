# Snake Game JS

## Objective

### The objective of the Snake Game is to navigate the snake to consume as much food as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. Each piece of food consumed increases the length of the snake, making the game progressively more challenging. The player aims to achieve the highest score possible by sustaining the snake's growth without crashing.
